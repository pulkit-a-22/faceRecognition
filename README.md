# faceRecognitionInAmazonAlexa
This program uses the photos in the database folder and compares them to the people shown in the recording of the RING doorbell once the doorbell is pressed. If a match is found, the program will announce " X is here" 

In order to achieve this, the program uses a deep-learning approach. More specifically, the program uses a pre-trained convolution neural network in order to detect and recognize photos from individual frames taken from the Amazon RING Camera. 

To learn more about the functions used in this program and the development of it, you can refer to the project report attactched in the files.
